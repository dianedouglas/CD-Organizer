# _CD Organizer_

#### _A Ruby command line progrma for practicing Behavior Driven Development with Object Oriented Ruby and a many-to-many relationship._

#### By Diane Douglas

## Description

This program lets you create a catalogue of CD objects from the command line allowing for searches by album or artist. CDs are then organized into groups by genre, where a Genre is itself a class. It was an exercise in writing Object Oriented Ruby. Specs are written for each class using RSpec to follow good Test Driven Development practices. 

## Setup/Installation Requirements

1. You need Ruby for this. Here are [the installation instructions](http://railsinstaller.org/en), and [an easy installer for Windows](http://rubyinstaller.org/)
2. You also need rspec to run the included Behavior Driven Development tests. Run this from the command line: `gem install rspec`. If you get permissions errors on a MAc you can run `sudo gem install rspec`. 
3. Clone or download this project and in your command line, change directory into the top level of the project folder. 
4. Run the tests with the command `rspec`. 
5. Run the program with the command `ruby CD_Organizer_ui.rb`.
